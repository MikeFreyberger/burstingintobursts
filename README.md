Website Traffic Analysis Countermeasures

All .py files are intended to be run as countermeaures within Kevin Dyer's testing framework found at https://github.com/kpdyer/website-fingerprinting.

Clone both of our repos. 

Add my .py files to his countermeasures folder. If you want to run tests with these countermeasures import the file into main.py, and make a new condition for a -c configuration number in his main file. For instance, you can set the main.py file to run BurstPadAllFixed if main.py is run with -c 11.
